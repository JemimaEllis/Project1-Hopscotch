##Instructions


Cloud hop is a numbers typing game. In this game there are 2 different modes.

* Mode 1: This is a speed challenge. There are 20 clouds, to proceed to the next cloud you must type the number on the present cloud. The idea is to complete all 20 clouds in the fastest time possible.

* Mode 2: This is an accuracy challenge. One wrong type and it's game over. The amount of clouds are infinite, however, to make it a bit harder, the speed of the clouds moving across the screen will speed up as you go!


How to play:

* To play, simply select your mode. Once your mode is selected the game will commence immediatly, so make sure you read the instructions before you start!

* If you wish to restart the game, simply click restart. Likewise, if you wish to change modes, click on the "instructions/modes" button.


#Languages

For this game html, css, and javascript were used. These were used in correlation with each other in order to produce the final product.

#Future modifications

To improve this game for the future there are a couple of modifications that could take place.

* 1) Add difficulty levels to mode 2 by having the clouds move at different paces.
* 2) Create a 3rd mode. This could be a maze where you have to click the numbers on the correct route to get out, but if you get it wrong you have to click the same numbers again to backtrack. The aim would be to get to the finish line in the fewest steps.
