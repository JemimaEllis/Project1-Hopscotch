How to run


Cloud hop is a numbers typing game. In this game there are 2 different modes.

Mode 1: This is a speed challenge. There are 20 clouds, to proceed to the next cloud you must type the number on the present cloud. The idea is to complete all 20 clouds in the fastest time possible.

Mode 2: This is an accuracy challenge. One wrong type and it's game over. The amount of clouds are infinite, however, to make it a bit harder, the speed of the clouds moving across the screen will speed up as you go!
